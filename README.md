# ROCO-224 Robotic arm

## Group BFA - Teleoperated Space Manipulator

## Programming industrial robots (approximately 1000 words)

## BRIEF

### Background:
Currently there are large-scale robot arms being used in space operations, for example on the International Space Station (ISS). These robot manipulators are used to help assemble the station, move astronauts around (with foot restraints), and to dock some spacecraft to the station. These manipulators are typically controlled by astronauts inside the space station, however there has been significant interest in teleoperating such robot arms, in orbit and perhaps on the moon, from ground stations on earth. This would be enabled by multiple camera views of the arm in operation. This would enable many more robot arms to be used, and also to reduce the costs associated with keeping the astronauts occupied with performing these tedious tasks. However, when teleoperating from earth there can be considerable time-delays on the communications, often up to multiple seconds from joystick control input to visual feedback.

###  Goal: 
Your goal is to design a small robot manipulator for space teleoperation (for 1-G environment, sorry no spaceflight possible during duration of this project), and simulate the limited camera views and time-delay in the human-robot control loop. The arm design should be emulating the design of typical space manipulators but at a small scale, see for example the Dextre, Canadarm2 and the old Shuttle Remote Manipulator System: SRMS.

### Constraints:
This project would require at least one camera view, preferably multiple, and you would be asked to design an experiment to test the system simulating the distance/delay (by e.g. sitting in an adjoining room). The task could be to ideally grasp and move a set of modules (say a set of cylinders/cubes etc sat loosely in a set of slots) to another location (say another set of slots), and back again in the minimum amount of time. The minimum movement distance for each modules to be moved is 25 cm. The arm should be teleoperated with your preferred input device. Additional autonomous functionality would be a bonus.
